*She wanted to find out how many types of churros are there.*

*She had a plan. It was about the special churro flavor that kamala had*
*that was being dicussed at the conference.* 

*Lot of people had come with samples of their flavor churros.*

*Tables were set up to display churro samples for people to taste.*

*Names of those how had prepared were dispayed and they were standing near that table.*

*Visitors were tasing and talking about the flavors.*

*Kamala Fox also had one table for her. Everyone loved her flavor.*

*No one had ever tasted that flavor.*

*There was voting for best flavor.*
The next day kamala woke up and got in to her car and went to Humboldt

She started to walk to the building  and then entered the building and sat down and listend to the conversation at the end it was made a churro.
